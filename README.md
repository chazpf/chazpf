![Hello](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ConsciousAmbitiousAntipodesgreenparakeet-size_restricted.gif)

## How extremely cool of you to visit my GitHub

### I'm glad you made it

#### My pronouns are he/him

I'm currently enrolled in **General Assembly's** *Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp* fulltime. I'll be finished Dec 9th and I'm eager to get to work. 

My journey has taken me from a creative writing degree, to performing local comedy, to teaching preschool, to learning Agile for Scrum Master certification, to teaching myself the basics of web development, to now. Ask me about anything I've done! 

My major projects include:
- [Monster Autobattler](https://github.com/chazpf/Monster_AutoBattle)
- [Junk Droor](https://github.com/chazpf/Junk-Droor)
- Tinier Bananas, which has a seperate [front end](https://github.com/chazpf/Tinier_Bananas-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/chazpf/Tinier_Bananas-backend)
- Brackets-R-Us, which also has a seperate [front end](https://github.com/squaye6756/BracketsRUs-front) and [back end](https://github.com/squaye6756/BracketsRUs-back)

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chazformichella/), where I'm always looking to expand my network.
